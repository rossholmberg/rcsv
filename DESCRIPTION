Description: Building a (very minor) extension to the standard csv format to allow easy data storage and recall in R
    without losing data structure. Column classes are stored in a
    `rcsvHeader` section, to be used when reading the data back into R again.
    Options are available for storing some data as converted numeric, to be converted back again
    on import. This can save disk space, and can allow for higher precision data storage with,
    for example, `times` class data.
    If no conversions are used, the file is still readable as a regular csv by any software, simply
    mark "#" as a comment character to skip the `rcsvHeader` lines.

Description: Building a (very minor) extension to the standard csv format to allow easy data storage and recall in R
    without losing data structure. Column classes, as well as list element classes for list columns*, are stored in a
    `#head:` line, to be used when reading the data back into R again.
        * Only list columns with a consistent class (ie: all elements of the columns share the same class) are supported.
    List columns with inconsistent class will be coerced to character class.

\usage{
write_rcsv(table, file, strings.convert = FALSE,
  strings.as.factor.ints = strings.convert,
  factors.as.ints = strings.convert, dates.as.ints = strings.convert,
  posix.as.num = strings.convert, times.as.num = strings.convert,
  ITimes.as.ints = strings.convert)
}
\arguments{
\item{table}{a data.table or data.frame object to write out}

\item{file}{file path to which the rscv will be written}

\item{strings.convert}{global switching of storage conversion types}

\item{strings.as.factor.ints}{logical, convert strings to factors,
and write to file as integer. May save space on disk}

\item{factors.as.ints}{logical, write factor columns to file as
integer, with "levels" stored in a header object. May save space on disk}

\item{dates.as.ints}{logical,  write date columns to file as
integer, with "tz" stored in a header object, and origin assumed to be
"1970-01-01". May save space on disk}

\item{posix.as.num}{logical, write POSIXct columns to file as
numeric, with "tz" stored in a header object, and origin assumed to be
"1970-01-01 00:00:00". May save space on disk}

\item{times.as.num}{logical, write `chron::times` columns to file as
numeric. Allows for sub-second precision to be stored, as opposed to
converting times to character, therefore only storing precision to seconds}

\item{ITimes.as.ints}{logical, write `ITime` columns to file as
integers. May save space on disk}
}
\description{
an extension of the csv file format
}
\details{
write out an rcsv file, an extension of csv, with column format details
stored in a header for more consistent reading into R
}
